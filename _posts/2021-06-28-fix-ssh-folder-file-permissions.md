`Permissions 0644 for '/home/<user>/.ssh/id_rsa' are too open.`

Windows obviously does not set the proper access rights to the files when copying them.
Following an article from stackoverflow I simply set the access rights of all the files in the .ssh folder to `600`.
This solves the issue but is actually not better, because each file has it's own permission for a reason.
Some files are read only for security reasons, some are even changed by your ssh client and need a different permission due to that.

## Looking up correct ssh folder file permissions

So I settled to fix the files using my personal device.
First I had to look up the the files permissions. 
You can use the following commands to show the configuration of the ssh folder and it's contents.
{% highlight bash %}
    stat -c "%a %n" ~/.ssh
    stat -c "%a %n" ~/.ssh/*
{% endhighlight %}
That is how the results looked like on my work machine.
Be aware thet depending on your usage not all files may exist on your machine.
{% highlight bash %}
    700 ~/.ssh
    600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    664 ~/.ssh/config
    400 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    600 ~/.ssh/known_hosts
{% endhighlight %}
You might also want to take a look at the owner of the files with the following command.
{% highlight bash %}
    ls -ld ~/.ssh
    ls -l ~/.ssh
{% endhighlight %}
The username should be set as the owner and the group of the files.
In case it diverges we are going to fix it in the next step.

## Fixing the file permissions 

The following commands should set up everything as before.
{% highlight bash %}
    sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/.ssh
    sudo chmod 700 ~/.ssh
    sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    sudo chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    sudo chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/known_hosts
{% endhighlight %}
Make sure everything is working as before.
That's it. 
I fixed my messed up ssh folder configuration and I can be sure that security issues due to wrong configuration should not be a concern anymore.
