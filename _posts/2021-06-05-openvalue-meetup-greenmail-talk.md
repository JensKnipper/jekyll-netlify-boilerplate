I really enjoyed the evening and the opportunity to speak at the [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/OpenValue/events/278102326/), thank you very much. Special thanks to [Bert Jan Schrijver](https://twitter.com/bjschrijver) for organizing the meetups.  
Unfortunately the audio quality is not as good as I hoped it would be. It seems like I connected with the wrong microphone.
